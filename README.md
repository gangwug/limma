# limma

This repository contains a GitHub copy of the limma package from BioConductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). 

Limma is an R package for the analysis of gene expression microarray data, especially
the use of linear models for analysing designed experiments and the assessment of differential expression. Limma provides the ability to analyse comparisons between many
RNA targets simultaneously in arbitrary complicated designed experiments. Empirical
Bayesian methods are used to provide stable results even when the number of arrays
is small. The normalization and data analysis functions are for two-color spotted microarrays. The linear model and differential expression functions apply to all microarray
technologies including Affymetrix and other single-channel oligonucleotide platforms.
